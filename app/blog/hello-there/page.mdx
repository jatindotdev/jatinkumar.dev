## Hello there!

I'm a software engineer who loves to build things. I'm passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working on a variety of projects and learning new things along the way.

As part of my continuous learning journey, I'm currently working on a few side projects, including a personal blog, a web app for task management, and exploring open-source contributions. I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with others and expand my skill set.

See you around!
